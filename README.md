# Hospital-System-Java-Assignment
Introduction
---
This project aims to provide a simple hospital system implemented in Java. The system allows nurses to input patient temperature readings over several days and performs various analyses on the data, including calculating averages, finding maximum and minimum temperatures, sorting temperature readings, and determining if a patient can be discharged based on their temperature stability.

Functionality
---
The Hospital class serves as the main entry point for the system. Upon execution, the user is prompted to input various data, such as the number of days a patient has been in the hospital, the number of temperature readings per day, and the actual temperature readings.

The system then performs the following analyses:
---

*Summary: Calculates and prints the maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and average temperature across all readings.

*Count Below/Above Average: Counts and prints the number of temperature readings below and above the calculated average.

*Sort Array: Sorts the temperature readings in ascending order and prints the sorted array.

*Leave Hospital: Determines if the patient's average temperature stability allows for discharge from the hospital.

Notes:
---
->Temperature readings are expected to be in Celsius and are validated within the range of 30째C to 45째C.

->Discharge criteria are based on an average temperature range of 35.5째C to 36.5째C.
